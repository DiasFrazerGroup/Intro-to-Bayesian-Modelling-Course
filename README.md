# Intro-to-Bayesian-Modelling-Course
This repository contains material from a 4 hours course aimed at incoming biology PhD students. 

The course consisted of a one hour lecture, followed by a three hour hands-on tutorial on probabilistic programming with (Num)Pyro, done in Google Colab. The course places a strong emphasis on model building considerations and is relatively light on inference. Despite being aimed at biologists, there is no knowledge of biology assumed in this course.
